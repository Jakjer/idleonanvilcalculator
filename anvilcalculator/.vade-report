# Implementation Report: Vercel Web Analytics

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Idle-On Anvil Calculator React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (version ^1.6.1) to the project dependencies
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new dependency and its sub-dependencies

### 2. Modified Files

#### src/App.tsx
- **Added import**: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`
- **Added component**: Placed `<Analytics />` component at the end of the main app container (before the closing div)

### 3. Implementation Details
This is a React application using Vite as the build tool. Following the Vercel Web Analytics documentation for React applications (create-react-app pattern), I:

1. Added the `@vercel/analytics` package to dependencies
2. Imported the `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
3. Placed the Analytics component in the App.tsx file to track page views across the application

The Analytics component is a wrapper around the tracking script that seamlessly integrates with React applications.

### 4. Verification Steps Completed
✅ Build successful: `npm run build` completed without errors
✅ Linting passed: `npm run lint` reported no issues
✅ Lock files updated: package-lock.json properly updated with new dependencies

## Next Steps for Users
After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab)
2. Deploy the application using `vercel deploy`
3. Visit the deployed site and check browser Network tab for requests to `/_vercel/insights/view`
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Notes
- The implementation preserves all existing functionality
- No route support is needed for this simple single-page application
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views when deployed to Vercel
- In development mode, analytics will run in development mode and won't send production data
